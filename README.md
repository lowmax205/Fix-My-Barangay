# Fix-My-Barangay
Fix My Barangay is a lightweight reporting platform that empowers residents to submit local public infrastructure  or safety issues (e.g., damaged roads, drainage problems, streetlight outages). It centralizes reports, enriches  them with geolocated and photographed before being routed to local government authorities to take actions.
